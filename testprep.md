## Test Prep plans: 
Include snippets of code into github pages and complete all Challenges this Trimester on [Repl.it](https://replit.com/@JSinghSD/PersonalRepo1#README.md)
- Do all of the FRQs that I missed in Tri 2, or at least the ones I can.
- Finally finish the Random Passcode generator that I was supposed to turn in at the end of tri 2.
- Link to password generator: [Here](https://replit.com/@JSinghSD/CSACollegeboardFRQ)
